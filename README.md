Hi! I'm Trung, I'm a software engineering student at Van Lang University. 

My passion for software is to start with my own ideas and participate in building those ideas. I am studying back-end and database because it sparks interest in me, besides I also learn more about UX/UI, architecture.
I am currently aiming for a back-end developer position after graduation and I will further develop as I gain enough experience in the areas that interest me.

Ask me about anything, I'll be happy to help.
